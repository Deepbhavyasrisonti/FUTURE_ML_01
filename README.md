📈 Retail Sales Forecasting Dashboard

Task 1 | Future Interns – Machine Learning Internship (Track: ML)

This project builds a Sales Forecasting Model using monthly retail sales data.
The model predicts future sales for upcoming months using Time-Series Forecasting (ARIMA) and includes visualizations, EDA, and exportable forecast outputs.

⭐ Project Overview

This forecasting system analyses historical monthly sales data and predicts future trends.
It includes:

✔ Trend visualization
✔ Time-series preprocessing
✔ ARIMA forecasting model
✔ Exportable forecast output
✔ Clean code + notebook structure

This project is fully aligned with Task 1 requirements in the Future Interns PDF.

📁 Dataset

A simple Retail Time-Series Dataset with two columns:

Month	Sales
2021-01	12000
2021-02	13000
...	...

Dataset includes 24 months of sales values.

🧠 Features
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Monthly sales visualization

Identifying sales trend

Understanding seasonality

✔ Time-Series Forecasting

ARIMA Model (2,1,2)

Next 3 months forecast

Forecast plotted against historical data

✔ Output

Forecast exported as a CSV file

Notebook and code included

🛠 Tech Stack

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Statsmodels (ARIMA)

Google Colab

CSV dataset

📊 Visualizations

The notebook includes visualizations like:

Monthly Sales Trend Plot

Forecast vs Historical Sales Plot

These help understand patterns and forecast accuracy.

🚀 How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Install dependencies (if running locally)
pip install pandas matplotlib statsmodels

2️⃣ Run code

Load dataset → Build ARIMA model → Generate forecast → Plot results.

📄 Output File

Forecast results are saved as:

sales_forecast_output.csv


This contains future predicted sales for the next 3 months.

📌 Internship Requirement Completed

This project fulfills the Task 1 requirements:

✔ Time-series forecasting
✔ Dashboard-ready output
✔ Trend visualization
✔ GitHub repo maintenance
✔ PDF-compatible and submission-ready
